## Description of contents:
Modeled with Autodesk Inventor 2018

* solar_harvester_145x145.iam - full assembly of finished device.
* solar_harvester_145x145.ipn - presentation file with exploded view.
When rendered in reverse, results in video with assembly instructions.
* washer.pdf - template for silicone/rubber washer that goes
between the lid and enclosure of harvester (to ensure it's watertight).
* stl/ - folder with 3D printed parts.
* enclosure/ - Inventor models of enclosure, source of everything 3D printed in stl/ folder. 
* step/ - same models as in enclosure/ directory, STEP file format. 
* parts/ - Inventor models of constituent electronics (e.g. everything not hand-crafted).
* media/ - rendered stills and videos.

## TODO
* Add a stopper to SP16 back nut, that will prevent the nut from slipping.
* Utilize internal space more (shrink 3d printed parts).
